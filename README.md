<h2>HONEYPOT SERVER USING ARDUINO</h2>
<br>Honeypots are usually deployed inside production networks alongside
production servers, the honeypot plays the role of a decoy as part of the
production network intrusion detection system (IDS). A production
honeypot is designed to appear real and contains duplicate information to
attract and occupy hackers to tie up their time and resources, ultimately
giving administrators time to assess and mitigate any vulnerabilities in
their actual production systems.
A honeypot server consists of a computer, applications and data that
simulate the behaviour of a real system and appears as part of a network;
however, the honeypot is actually isolated. Viewing and logging this
activity can help improve security by providing insight into the level and
types of threat a network infrastructure faces while distracting attackers
away from assets of real value. Researchers suspect that some
cybercriminals use honeypots themselves to gather intelligence about
researchers, act as decoys and to spread misinformation.
The aim of the project is to make a honeypot using Arduino. It is cost
efficient because they do not require high-performance resources to
process large volumes of network traffic looking for attacks, because they
only interact with malicious activities
